# Methodology for the elaboration of the work.
## Design sprints
We decided to use this methodology due to its speed, facility to collaborate and adaptability. According to its definition we worked on sprints, these with a duration of 5 days each, having a total of 2.
At the start of each Sprint we made reunions to decide on what we were going to do in the designated periods of time.
